The project of bank panic uses Commercial and Financial Chronicles (CFC) and macrohistory data

I'm going to use Commercial and Financial Chronicle (CFC) and the Jord√†-Schularick-Taylor Macrohistory Database to analyze what triggered "bank panic" or "bank run" in the history of U.S. Before the economic crisis, there is always a sign or trend of economic slow down. There are reports about the economic slow-down and tight monetary liquidity in the newspapers articles. The effects accumulate, but no one knows when it will happen nor what will trigger it. Macroeconomic data is not enough to find out the truth. Using NLP with CFC, I can collect information of individual bank or company, providing solid micro data for analysis. Combing the micro data with the macrohistory data, I expect to answer the following question: 1, what triggered the bank panic? 2, is there a clear sign before it happened? 3, how did people's expectation change? 4. Was the change of expectation a cause or a result of bank panic?

By doing this project, I will provide new dataset of CFC and structured data about bank panic.
